      description: 'Cambria has been designed for on-screen reading and to look good
        when printed at small sizes. It has very even spacing and proportions. Diagonal
        and vertical hairlines and serifs are relatively strong, while horizontal
        serifs are small and intend to emphasize stroke endings rather than stand
        out themselves. This principle is most noticeable in the italics where the
        lowercase characters are subdued in style to be at their best as elements
        of word-images. When Cambria is used for captions at sizes over 20 point,
        the  inter-character spacing should be slightly reduced for best results.
        The design isn''t just intended for business documents: The regular weight
        has been extended with a large set of math and science symbols. The Greek
        and Cyrillic has been designed under close supervision of an international
        team of experts, who aimed to set a historical new standard in multi-script
        type design.'

  It is a fact that Linux lacks good high quality fonts for general use. In
  the other hand, Microsoft invests time and money to provide a nice and
  clean look and feel with high quality fonts like Verdana and Tahoma. The
  result of this work is found in their typography
  (http://microsoft.com/typography) web site. This is an attempt to give
  Linux end users a very easy way to use them, trough an RPM package.

  These fonts are free only for who have a Microsoft Windows license.
