    description: 'Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 and
      extended in the Summer 2013 by Warsaw-based designer Lukasz Dziedzic ("Lato"
      means "Summer" in Polish). It tries to carefully balance some potentially conflicting
      priorities: it should seem quite "transparent" when used in body text but would
      display some original traits when used in larger sizes. The classical proportions,
      particularly visible in the uppercase, give the letterforms familiar harmony
      and elegance. At the same time, its sleek sanserif look makes evident the fact
      that Lato was designed in the 2010s, even though it does not follow any current
      trend. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth,
      while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. In 2013-2014,
      the family was greatly extended (with the help of Adam Twardoch and Botio Nikoltchev)
      to cover 3000+ glyphs over nine weights with italics. It now supports 100+ Latin-based
      languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA phonetics.

      priorities: it should seem quite "transparent" when used in body text but would
      display some original traits when used in larger sizes. The classical proportions,
      particularly visible in the uppercase, give the letterforms familiar harmony
      and elegance. At the same time, its sleek sanserif look makes evident the fact
      that Lato was designed in the 2010s, even though it does not follow any current
      trend. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth,
      while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. In 2013-2014,
      the family was greatly extended (with the help of Adam Twardoch and Botio Nikoltchev)
      to cover 3000+ glyphs over nine weights with italics. It now supports 100+ Latin-based
      languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA phonetics.

  -----------------------------------------------------------

  PREAMBLE
  The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
  development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
  efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
  open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
  with others.

  The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
  redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
  fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
  redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
  names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
  however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
  requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
  to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

  DEFINITIONS

  Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
  include source files, build scripts and documentation.

  "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
  copyright statement(s).

  "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
  distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

  "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
