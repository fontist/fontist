Fontist lets you find and download fonts for Windows, Linux and Mac.

Fontist is designed to facilitate automated and unattended management of font
installations on modern operating systems.

Fontist provides a repository of open
https://github.com/fontist/formulas[Fontist Formulas] that can be easily
installed, and also supports private font formula repositories for private or
licensed commercial fonts.

Learn more (and find your font) at https://www.fontist.org[fontist.org].

:toc:

== Installation

Install it directly as:

[source,sh]
----
gem install fontist
----

Or use it as part of your bundle by adding this line to your application's
`Gemfile`:

[source,ruby]
----
gem "fontist"
----

And then execute:

[source,sh]
----
bundle install
----

=== Fetch formulas

After installation, please fetch formulas via the `fontist` command:

[source,sh]
----
fontist update
----

=== Dependencies

Depends on
https://github.com/fontist/ffi-libarchive-binary[ffi-libarchive-binary] which
has the following requirements:

* zlib
* Expat
* OpenSSL (for Linux only)

These dependencies are generally present on all systems.

NOTE: As of v2.1, Fontist uses modern, pure-Ruby font processing libraries:
`fontisan` for font metadata extraction and collection handling (replacing the
legacy `ttfunk` and `extract_ttc` gems), and `marcel` for MIME type detection
(replacing `mime-types`). These changes improve cross-platform compatibility
and eliminate external binary dependencies.


== Using the command-line interface (CLI)

=== The `fontist` command

These commands makes possible to operate with fonts via command line.

The CLI properly supports exit status, so in a case of error it returns a status
code higher or equal than `1`.

Searches are case-insensitive for ease of use.

All commands support the following global options:

`--preferred-family`:: Search using the "`preferred family`" name of a font.
(instead of the "`default family`" name, the default prior to Fontist v1.10.)

NOTE: See <<preferred-family-change>> for the differences between
"`preferred family`" and "`default family`".

`-q, --quiet`:: Print as little information as possible, mostly critical errors.

`-v, --verbose`:: Set the log level to debug. It prints formulas excluded
during installation and information for developers of fontist.

`-c, --no-cache`:: Prefer direct download even when a file is already cached in
a system.

=== Install fonts: `fontist install`

Fontist checks whether this font is already installed, and if not, then installs
the font and returns its installed paths.

The font name is the only argument to be supplied.

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist install "segoe ui"
These fonts are found or installed:
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUI.TTF
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUIB.TTF
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUII.TTF
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUIZ.TTF
----

Multiple fonts can be installed in a single command:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist install "segoe ui" "roboto" "arial"
Successfully installed 3 font(s): segoe ui, roboto, arial
----

When installing multiple fonts, Fontist will continue installing remaining fonts
even if one fails, and report all results at the end:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist install "segoe ui" "nonexistent font" "roboto"
Successfully installed 2 font(s): segoe ui, roboto
Failed to install 1 font(s):
  - nonexistent font: Font 'nonexistent font' not found...
----

By default, all matching styles (according to the font's "`default family`"
name) are installed.

NOTE: Prior to v1.10, the font's "`preferred family`" name is used to match
styles for search. See <<preferred-family-change>> for details of that change.

To install all fonts specified in a Fontist formula, use the `-F, --formula`
option.

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist install --formula 'courier_prime'
Downloading font ...
Installing font "courier_prime".
Fonts installed at:
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/Courier Prime Bold Italic.ttf
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/Courier Prime Bold.ttf
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/Courier Prime Italic.ttf
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/Courier Prime.ttf
----

Here, `courier_prime` is the filename of the formula located at the public
Fontist Formula repository
(https://github.com/fontist/formulas/blob/v3/Formulas/courier_prime.yml[`courier_prime.yml`]).

You can also specify the human-readable name of the formula. This name is
derived from the filename, with underscores replaced by spaces. It's not
case-sensitive, meaning you can use capital letters if you prefer.

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist install --formula "Courier Prime"
$ fontist install --formula "Google/Noto Sans"
----

Installation by the formula name supports suggestions in CLI when input is
partial:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist install --formula 'noto s'
Formula 'noto s' not found. Did you mean?
[0] Google/Noto Sans
[1] Google/Noto Serif
Please type number or press ENTER to skip installation:
----

NOTE: Specifying the font's filename is not supported yet.

If there are several formulas with a requested font, then `fontist` searches
for the newest version of the font among formulas with size below a limit
(300 MB). This behavior can be changed with options.

NOTE: If styles of a font are spread among several formulas, then all
available styles from all formulas would be installed.

NOTE: Some formulas may have the `min_fontist` attribute, which defines the
minimum version of fontist by which they can be installed. If `fontist` is of a
older version, then the formula is avoided to use. In order to see which
formulas were excluded from the search, the `-v, --verbose` option can be
specified.

Supported options:

`-f, [--force]`:: Install even if already installed in system
`-F, [--formula]`:: Install whole formula instead of a font
`-a, [--accept-all-licenses]`:: Accept all license agreements
`-h, [--hide-licenses]`:: Hide license texts
`-p, [--no-progress]`:: Hide download progress
`-V, [--version=VERSION]`:: Install particular version of a font
`-s, [--smallest]`:: Install the smallest font by file size if several
`-n, [--newest]`:: Install the newest version of a font if several
`-S, [--size-limit=N]`:: Specify upper limit for file size of a formula to be installed
                       (default is 300 MB)
`-u, [--update-fontconfig]`:: Update Fontconfig


NOTE: The `install` command is similar to the `Font.install` library call.


=== Uninstall fonts: `fontist uninstall`

Uninstalls any font supported by Fontist.

Returns paths of an uninstalled font, or prints an error telling that the font
isn't installed or could not be found in Fontist formulas. Aliased as `remove`.

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist uninstall "segoe ui"
These fonts are removed:
/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUII.TTF
/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUIZ.TTF
/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUIB.TTF
/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUI.TTF
----

=== Status: `fontist status`

Prints installed font paths with a corresponding formula.

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist status "segoe ui"
Fonts found at:
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUII.TTF (from segoe_ui formula)
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUIZ.TTF (from segoe_ui formula)
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUIB.TTF (from segoe_ui formula)
- /Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUI.TTF (from segoe_ui formula)
----

=== List: `fontist list`

Lists installation status of fonts supported by Fontist.

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist list "segoe ui"
segoe_ui
 Segoe UI
  Regular (installed)
  Bold (installed)
  Italic (installed)
  Bold Italic (installed)
----

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist list "roboto mono"
google/roboto_mono
 Roboto Mono
  Regular (not installed)
  Italic (not installed)
----

=== List installed font paths: `fontist manifest locations`

Returns locations of fonts specified in a YAML file as an input.

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist manifest locations MANIFEST_FILE
----

`MANIFEST_FILE` is the location of a manifest file that contains specification
of one or multiple font and font styles.

A manifest file `manifest.yml` could look like:
====
[source,yml]
----
Segoe UI:
- Regular
- Bold
Roboto Mono:
- Regular
----
====

The following command will return the following YAML output:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist manifest locations manifest.yml
----

[source,yml]
----
---
Segoe UI:
  Regular:
    full_name: Segoe UI
    paths:
    - "/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUI.TTF"
  Bold:
    full_name: Segoe UI Bold
    paths:
    - "/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUIB.TTF"
Roboto Mono:
  Regular:
    full_name: Roboto Mono Regular
    paths:
    - "/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/RobotoMono-VariableFont_wght.ttf"
----
----

If one or more of requested fonts are missing, the "3" error code would be
returned, and a message printed:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist manifest locations manifest.yml
'Roboto Mono' 'Regular' font is missing, please run `fontist install 'Roboto Mono'` to download the font.
$ echo $?
3
----

=== Install fonts from manifest: `fontist manifest install`

You can install all fonts specified in the manifest file:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist manifest install --confirm-license manifest.yml
----

Where `manifest.yaml` is:

[source,yml]
----
---
Segoe UI:
  Regular:
    full_name: Segoe UI
    paths:
    - "/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUI.TTF"
  Bold:
    full_name: Segoe UI Bold
    paths:
    - "/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUIB.TTF"
Roboto Mono:
  Regular:
    full_name: Roboto Mono Regular
    paths:
    - "/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/RobotoMono-VariableFont_wght.ttf"
----
----

=== Work with fontist config: `fontist config`

Fontist supports system-wide settings for the following parameters:

`fonts_path`:: Sets path where to install fonts (default: `~/.fontist/fonts`)

`open_timeout`:: Sets timeout for opening a connection during download
(default: `60`)

`read_timeout`:: Sets timeout for reading the opened connection during download
(default: `60`)

Show current attributes in the config:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist config show
Current config:
read_timeout: 5
----

Assign a value to an attribute:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist config set read_timeout 60
----

Restore a default value of an attribute:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist config delete read_timeout
----

=== Work with Fontconfig: `fontist fontconfig`

`fontconfig` is a software designed to provide fonts to other programs. It is
typically used on Linux, but also available on macOS and Windows. `fontconfig`
is used by LibreOffice, GIMP, and many other programs.

It order to find Fontist fonts, `fontconfig` should be updated to include
Fontist paths. It can be done with the `--update-fontconfig` option of the
`install` command, or by calling the following command directly:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist fontconfig update
----

This command will create a Fontist-specific `fontconfig` config file at
`~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/10-fontist.conf`.

To remove it, please use:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist fontconfig remove
----


[[fontist-caches]]
=== Working with caches

==== General

Fontist implements two types of caches to optimize performance and reduce
redundant downloads:

* *Download cache* (`~/.fontist/downloads`): Font files downloaded by end users
via `fontist install`

* *Import cache* (*maintainer-only*) (`~/.fontist/import_cache`): Font archives
downloaded during formula imports

These caches can be managed using the `fontist cache` command.

==== Clear download cache

The following commands will clear Fontist's caches.

Clear download cache:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist cache clear
Cache has been successfully removed.
----

Clear import cache:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist cache clear-import
Import cache cleared: 128.7 MB
----


==== View cache information

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist cache info
Font download cache:
  Location: /Users/user/.fontist/downloads
  Size: 45.3 MB
  Files: 12

Import cache:
  Location: /Users/user/.fontist/import_cache
  Size: 128.7 MB
  Files: 8
----




=== Manage system font index: `fontist index`

==== General

Fontist maintains an index of system fonts for fast lookups. The `fontist index`
command provides tools to manage this index.

==== Rebuild index: `fontist index rebuild`

Rebuild the system font index from scratch:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist index rebuild
System font index rebuilt successfully
----

With verbose output to see progress and statistics:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist index rebuild --verbose
Rebuilding system font index from scratch...

NOTE: The first rebuild will parse all fonts and take 3-5 minutes. Subsequent
rebuilds leverage file-level caching and complete in seconds if fonts haven't
changed.

==== Incremental build: `fontist index build`

Build or update the index incrementally (faster than rebuild):

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist index build --verbose
----

==== Show index information: `fontist index info`

Display information about the current index:

[source,sh]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

==== Clear index: `fontist index clear`

Delete the system font index (will be rebuilt on next use):

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist index clear
System font index cleared: /Users/user/.fontist/system_index.default_family.yml
----

==== Index command options

All `fontist index` commands support these options:

`-v, --verbose`:: Show detailed progress and statistics
`-o, --output=PATH`:: Save index to specified path (for inspection)

[example]
====
[source,sh]
----
$ fontist index rebuild --verbose --output /tmp/my-index.yml
----
====

=== Help: `fontist help`

List of all commands could be seen by:

[source,sh]
----
fontist help
----

=== Configuration with environment variables

By default Fontist uses the `~/.fontist` directory to store fonts and its
files. It could be changed with the `FONTIST_PATH` environment variable.

[source,sh]
----
FONTIST_PATH=~/.fontist_new fontist update
----


== Using the Ruby library

=== `Fontist::Font`

The `Fontist::Font` is your go-to place to deal with any font using Fontist.

This interface allows you to find a font or install a font.

==== Finding a font

The `Fontist::Font.find` interface can be used a find a font in your system.

It will look into the operating system specific font directories, and also the
fontist specific `~/.fontist` directory.

[source,ruby]
----
Fontist::Font.find(name)
----

* If Fontist finds a font, then it will return the paths.

* Otherwise, it will either raise an unsupported font error, or trigger display
of installation instructions for that specific font.

==== Install a font

The `Fontist::Font.install` interface can be used to install any supported font.

This interface first checks if you already have that font installed or not and
if you do then it will return the paths.

If you don't have a font but that font is supported by Fontist, then it will
download the font and copy it to `~/.fontist` directory and also return the
paths.

[source,ruby]
----
Fontist::Font.install(name, confirmation: "no")
----

If there are issues detected with the provided font, such as the font is not
supported, those errors would be raised.

==== List all fonts

The `Fontist::Font` interface exposes an interface to list all supported fonts.

This might be useful if want to know the name of the font or the available
styles. You can do that by using:

[source,ruby]
----
Fontist::Font.all
----

The return values are model objects, so you can easily access their properties
and perform operations on them.

=== `Fontist::Formula`

The `fontist` gem internally usages the `Fontist::Formula` interface to find a
registered formula or fonts supported by any formula. Unless, you need to do
anything with that you shouldn't need to work with this interface directly. But
if you do then these are the public interface it offers.

==== Find a formula

The `Fontist::Formula.find` interface allows you to find any of the registered
formula. This interface takes a font name as an argument and it looks through
each of the registered formula that offers this font installation. Usages:

[source,ruby]
----
Fontist::Formula.find("Calibri")
----

This method will search and return a Fontist formula for the provided keyword
which allows for further processing, such as license checks or proceeding with
installation of the font in your system.

==== List font styles supported by a formula

Normally, each font name can be associated with multiple styles or collection,
for example the `Calibri` font might contains a `regular`, `bold` or `italic`
styles fonts and if you want a interface that can return the complete list then
this is your friend.

You can use it as following:

[source,ruby]
----
Fontist::Formula.find_fonts("Calibri")
----

==== List all formulas

The `Fontist::Formula` interface exposes an interface to list all registered
font formula. This might be useful if want to know the name of the formula or
what type fonts can be installed using that formula. Usages:

[source,ruby]
----
Fontist::Formula.all
----

The return values are model objects, so you can easily access their properties
and perform operations on them.

=== `Fontist::Manifest`

==== Global options

Fontist can be switched to use the preferred family names. This format was
used prior to v1.10.

[source,ruby]
----
Fontist.preferred_family = true
----

[[fontist-locations]]
==== Locations

Fontist lets you find font locations from a defined manifest Hash in the
following format:

[source,ruby]
----
{
  "Segoe UI"=>["Regular", "Bold"],
  "Roboto Mono"=>["Regular"]
}
----

Calling the following code returns a nested Hash with font paths and names.
Font name is useful to choose a specific font in a font collection file (TTC).

[source,ruby]
----
Fontist::Manifest.from_hash(manifest, locations: true)
----

[source,ruby]
----
{
  "Segoe UI"=> {
    "Regular"=>{
      "full_name"=>"Segoe UI",
      "paths"=>["/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUI.TTF"]
    },
    "Bold"=>{
      "full_name"=>"Segoe UI Bold",
      "paths"=>["/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUIB.TTF"]
    }
  },
  "Roboto Mono"=> {
    "Regular"=>{
      "full_name"=>nil,
      "paths"=>[]
    }
  }
}
----

[[fontist-install]]
==== Install

Fontist lets you not only to obtain font locations but also to install fonts
from the manifest:

[source,ruby]
----
manifest.install(confirmation: "yes")
----

It will install fonts and return their locations:

[source,ruby]
----
{
  "Segoe UI"=> {
    "Regular"=>{
      "full_name"=>"Segoe UI",
      "paths"=>["/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUI.TTF"]},
    "Bold"=>{
      "full_name"=>"Segoe UI Bold",
      "paths"=>["/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/SEGOEUIB.TTF"]
    }
  },
  "Roboto Mono"=> {
    "Regular"=>{
      "full_name"=>"Roboto Mono Regular",
      "paths"=>["/Users/user/.fontist/fonts/RobotoMono-VariableFont_wght.ttf"]
    }
  }
}
----

==== Support of YAML format

Both commands support a YAML file as an input with a `from_file` method. For
example, if there is a `manifest.yml` file containing:

[source,yaml]
----
---
Segoe UI:
- Regular
- Bold
Roboto Mono:
- Regular
----

Then the following calls would return font names and paths, as from the
`from_hash` method (see <<fontist-install>> and <<fontist-locations>>).

[source,ruby]
----
manifest = Fontist::Manifest.from_file("manifest.yml")
manifest.install(confirmation: "yes")
----

=== `Fontist::Fontconfig`

Fontist supports work with Fontconfig via the Ruby interface:

[source,ruby]
----
Fontist::Fontconfig.update              # let detect fontist fonts
Fontist::Fontconfig.remove              # disable detection
Fontist::Fontconfig.remove(force: true) # do not fail if no config exists
----


== Platform-specific features

=== macOS-specific add-on fonts

Newer versions of macOS provide on-demand installations of a wide range of
licensed fonts. These macOS-specific add-on fonts can be installed via Fontist.

A typical use for installing macOS add-on fonts is to allow CI jobs on
macOS environments to use these specially-licensed fonts not available on other
platforms.

This blog post describes how this works:

* https://www.fontist.org/blog/2022-02-11-macos-fonts/[Fontist blog: Installing macOS-specific add-on fonts]

For example, the "Canela" font is a commercial font that comes free with macOS.

Run this command to install Canela on macOS.

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist install Canela
----

The full list of available fonts on various macOS versions can be found on the
Apple Support site:

* https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213266[Fonts in macOS 13 Ventura]
* https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212587[Fonts in macOS 12 Monteray]
* https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT211240[Fonts in macOS 11 Big Sur]

WARNING: Fontist does not allow installing macOS-specific fonts on non-macOS
platforms due to font license restrictions of those fonts.

==== macOS Font Catalog Versioning

macOS supplementary fonts are distributed through two different catalogs:

* **Font7 Catalog**: For macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) through 15.7 (Sequoia)
* **Font8 Catalog**: For macOS 26.0 and later

These catalogs contain different versions of the same fonts, with Font8 providing
updated versions optimized for newer macOS releases.

===== Automatic Version Selection

When you install a macOS add-on font, Fontist automatically detects your macOS
version and installs the appropriate font version:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist install "Al Bayan"
# On macOS 14.2: installs Font7 version
# On macOS 26.0: installs Font8 version
----

This ensures you always get the font version compatible with your system.

===== Platform Tags

Formulas for Font7 and Font8 use distinct platform tags:

* `macos-font7`: For Font7 catalog fonts (macOS 10.11-15.7)
* `macos-font8`: For Font8 catalog fonts (macOS 26.0+)

===== Manual Catalog Import

For Fontist maintainers importing font catalogs manually:

[source,sh]
----
# Import Font7 catalog (macOS 10.11-15.7)
fontist import macos --plist com_apple_MobileAsset_Font7.xml

# Import Font8 catalog (macOS 26.0+)
fontist import macos --plist com_apple_MobileAsset_Font8.xml
----

Formulas are automatically saved to versioned directories:

* Font7 formulas: `~/.fontist/versions/{version}/formulas/Formulas/macos/font7/`
* Font8 formulas: `~/.fontist/versions/{version}/formulas/Formulas/macos/font8/`

This directory structure prevents conflicts between different catalog versions
of the same font.

===== Version Compatibility

When installing fonts, Fontist checks version compatibility:

[example]
====
[source,sh]
----
# On macOS 14.2 (Sonoma), trying to install a Font8-only formula:
$ fontist install "Font8OnlyFont"
Error: Font 'Font8OnlyFont' is only available for: macos-font8.
Your current platform is: macos. Your macOS version is: 14.2.1.
This font requires macOS 26.0 or later.
This font cannot be installed on your system.
----
====

If you encounter version compatibility issues, ensure you're running a
compatible macOS version for the requested font.

===== Font Version Tracking

Each macOS font formula includes a `font_version` attribute that stores the actual
version of the font file itself. This version is automatically extracted from the
font's metadata using the Fontisan library.

The `font_version` is distinct from the catalog version (Font7/Font8):
* `catalog_version`: Indicates which catalog the font belongs to (7 or 8)
* `font_version`: The actual version string from the font file (e.g., "2.137", "1.0")

This allows tracking of different font versions within the same catalog, as Apple
may update fonts between macOS releases.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
name: Al Bayan
catalog_version: 7
min_macos_version: "10.11"
max_macos_version: "15.7"
font_version: "2.137"
platforms:
  - macos-font7
resources:
  # ... resources ...
fonts:
  # ... fonts ...
----
====

The `font_version` is automatically extracted during formula creation and
included in the generated formula YAML file.
====

=== Known problematic fonts

* https://github.com/fontist/fontist/blob/main/lib/fontist/exclude.yml[List of fonts excluded from usage]


== Advanced usage

=== Using proxy servers

Fontist uses Git internally for fetching formulas and fonts.

In order to use Git functionality behind a proxy, you need to update your own
Git config via the `git config` command or the `~/.gitconfig` preference file.

There are many ways to configure your local Git install to use proxies.

The simplest, global way of setting a proxy for Git is the following.

* For HTTP
+
[source,sh]
----
git config --global http.proxy http://{user}:{pass}@{proxyhost}:{port}
----

* For HTTPS, you may need to handle SSL/TLS verification errors after setting
the proxy since the encryption end is located at your HTTPS proxy endpoint:
+

== Custom Fontist repositories

=== General

A Fontist repository is a Git repo which contains YAML Formula files.
Fontist Formulas can be created manually within a Fontist repository
(see https://github.com/fontist/formulas/tree/master/Formulas[examples]),
or <<create-formula,auto-generated from a font archive>>.

A Fontist repository can be accessed either through HTTPS or SSH. In case of
SSH, a corresponding SSH key should be setup with `ssh-agent` in order to access
this custom repository.

=== Registering a Fontist repository

The `fontist repo setup` command fetches a custom repository's formulas, and
stores the repository's name and URL for later use.

The `fontist repo setup` command uses the following syntax.

[source,sh]
----
fontist repo setup NAME URL
----

Internally, all custom Fontist repository information is stored at
`~/.fontist/formulas/Formulas/private`.

For example, given a Fontist repository called "acme" accessible via a
URL or an SSH address:

[source,sh]
----
fontist repo setup acme https://example.com/acme/formulas.git
# or
fontist repo setup acme git@example.com:acme/formulas.git
----


=== Listing custom Fontist repositories

[source,sh]
----
fontist repo list
----


=== Installing fonts from a Fontist repository

Once the custom Fontist repository is setup, one can install fonts from the
repo through its formulas:

[source,sh]
----
fontist install "custom font"
----


=== Updating a registered Fontist repository

If the custom Fontist formula repository is updated, the `repo update` command
is used to pull the newest changes:

[source,sh]
----
fontist repo update NAME
----

For example, given a Fontist repository called "acme", the following command
is used.

[source,sh]
----
fontist repo update acme
----


=== Removing a registered Fontist repository

If there is a need to remove a registered Fontist repository, the repo can be
removed with:

[source,sh]
----
fontist repo remove acme
----


=== Private access

Custom Fontist formulas and Fontist repositories can be made private to require
authentication.

For HTTPS and SSH Git Fontist repositories


=== Authentication for private formulas or private formula repositories

Authorization of private archives in private formulas can be implemented with
headers.

Here is an example which works with Github releases:

[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  fonts.zip:
    urls:
    - url: https://example.com/repos/acme/formulas/releases/assets/38777461
      headers:
        Accept: application/octet-stream
        Authorization: token ghp_1234567890abcdefghi
----

If the Fontist formula repository is a GitHub repo, a token can be obtained on
the https://github.com/settings/tokens[GitHub Settings > Tokens page].
This token should have at least the `repo` scope for access to these assets.



[[create-formula]]
=== Create Fontist formulas

==== General

Fontist formulas can be easily hand-crafted in YAML. However, the
auto-generation method is recommended for data accuracy and convenience.


==== Auto-generate a Fontist formula from a font archive

A formula could be generated from a fonts archive.

The `fontist create-formula` command allows detecting all font files from a
font archive in a multitude of formats (those supported by
https://github.com/fontist/excavate[Excavate], including zip, 7z, gzip, tar,
cab, exe).

The `fontist create-formula` command supports archives located at remote URLs or
local file paths.

For file paths, specify the file path as argument:

[source,sh]
----
wget https://www.latofonts.com/files/Lato2OFL.zip
fontist create-formula lato.zip
----

For URLs, simply specify the URL as the argument:

[source,sh]
----
fontist create-formula https://www.latofonts.com/files/Lato2OFL.zip
# > file created at lato.yml because the file downloaded is lato.zip
----

To test out the created formula, one may copy the formula into the user's
private formula repository location.

[source,sh]
----
fontist create-formula https://www.latofonts.com/files/Lato2OFL.zip
cp lato.yml ~/.fontist/formulas/Formulas/
----

==== Options for `create-formula`

The `create-formula` command supports several options to customize formula generation:

`--name`::
Specify a custom formula name instead of auto-detecting from fonts.
+
[source,sh]
----
fontist create-formula https://example.com/fonts.zip --name "My Custom Fonts"
----

`--subdir`::
Extract fonts only from a specific subdirectory within the archive.
Uses `fnmatch` patterns.
+
[source,sh]
----
fontist create-formula https://example.com/fonts.zip --subdir "fonts/otf"
----

`--file-pattern`::
Filter font files by pattern. Uses `fnmatch` patterns.
+
[source,sh]
----
fontist create-formula https://example.com/fonts.zip --file-pattern "*.otf"
----

`--name-prefix`::
Add a prefix to all font family names in the generated formula. This is useful
for distinguishing compatibility or replacement fonts from original proprietary
fonts.
+
[source,sh]
----
fontist create-formula https://dl.winehq.org/wine/source/10.x/wine-10.18.tar.xz \
  --subdir fonts \
  --file-pattern '*.ttf' \
  --name-prefix 'Wine '
----
+
This will generate a formula where all fonts have names prefixed with `"Wine "`,
such as "Wine Courier", "Wine Tahoma", "Wine Symbol", etc., making it clear
these are Wine compatibility fonts rather than the original Microsoft fonts.

`--mirror`::
Specify mirror URLs for the font archive (can be used multiple times).
+
[source,sh]
----
fontist create-formula https://example.com/fonts.zip \
  --mirror https://mirror1.example.com/fonts.zip \
  --mirror https://mirror2.example.com/fonts.zip
----

=== Overriding font metadata in Fontist formulas

The `fontist create-formula` command creates font formulas using information
embedded in the OTF metadata section.

However, some fonts (such as older fonts) often contain inconsistent or
imperfect metadata information. Some fonts for example applies different OTF
`Family` values for different font styles. This will result in all font styles
not being registered in the same Family.

Fontist formula authors can rectify this situation by using the `override:` key,
which allows the formula to override metadata information obtained from the font
metadata.

NOTE: The `override` key does not cause any change in the font files, it is only
for updating information used by Fontist internally.

The `override` key exists under the definition of individual font styles:

[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  ...
fonts:
- name: Original font name
  styles:
    - family_name: Original family name
      type: Original style
      override:
        family_name: Overridden family name
        type: Overridden style
        preferred_family_name: Overridden preferred family name
----

For example, the "Frutiger" fonts published by Adobe in 1994 use numbers to
represent the individual font styles, and have those names embedded in the OTF
`Family` field, such as "Frutiger 45 Light". These fonts also do not use the OTF
`Preferred Family` field, which is a more recent addition to OTF, due to their
age.

Here is how the `override` property can enforce all relevant styles to be
registered under the same family name (by overriding the `preferred_family_name`
value):

[source,yaml]
----
...
resources:
  ...
fonts:
- name: Frutiger 45 Light
  styles:
  - family_name: Frutiger 45 Light
    type: Regular
    full_name: Frutiger-Light
    post_script_name: Frutiger-Light
    override:
      preferred_family_name: Frutiger
  - ...
----

This fragment above will allow Fontist to generate correct indexes and allow
installation of all `Frutiger` fonts with a single command:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist install "Frutiger" --preferred-family
----

To install all fonts from a formula, the `-F, --formula` option can be used:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist install --formula ms_truetype
----



== Maintenance (for Fontist maintainers only!)

WARNING: This section is only for Fontist maintainers.

=== Formulas versioning

To add a new attribute, change how formula is treated or completely replace the
structure, there are 2 ways to change a formula format:

. Use the `min_fontist` attribute in a formula. It sets a requirement for
fontist to install the formula only if its version is equal or more than a
specified version.

. Use a new branch in the formulas repo, e.g. "v2", "v3", "v4", etc. After
creating a new branch, it should be defined in
https://github.com/fontist/fontist/blob/v1.16.0/lib/fontist.rb#L51[`Fontist.formulas_version`]

NOTE: Using a new branch would require all users to re-download the entire
formulas repo. Since this method has a significant overhead, the former one
(`min_fontist`) should be used whenever possible.


=== Import source architecture

==== General

Fontist imports font formulas from various external sources, and tracks the
origin and metadata of these imported formulas using a polymorphic
`import_source` attribute.

The `import_source` attribute contains metadata about where and when a font
formula was imported from, enabling formula versioning, update detection,
platform compatibility checks, and audit trails.

==== Import source types

Fontist supports multiple import source types, each with specific metadata:

macOS Supplementary Fonts::
Uses multi-dimensional versioning with framework version, catalog posted date,
and asset build ID.

Google Fonts::
Tracks commit ID from the Google Fonts repository, API version, last modified
date, and family ID.

SIL International Fonts::
Records the version string and release date.

==== macOS import source

macOS supplementary fonts use multi-dimensional versioning:

Framework Version:: Font7, Font8 - determines schema and parser
Catalog PostedDate:: Version of catalog within framework
Asset Build ID:: Individual package identifier

.Example import_source for macOS fonts
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
import_source:
  type: macos
  framework_version: 7
  posted_date: "2024-08-13T18:11:00Z"
  asset_id: "10m1360"
----
====

Framework-specific metadata (min/max macOS versions, parser classes) is stored
in link:lib/fontist/macos_framework_metadata.rb[`lib/fontist/macos_framework_metadata.rb`].

==== Google Fonts import source

.Example import_source for Google Fonts
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
import_source:
  type: google
  commit_id: "abc123def456"
  api_version: "v1"
  last_modified: "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
  family_id: "roboto"
----
====

==== SIL import source

.Example import_source for SIL International fonts
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
import_source:
  type: sil
  version: "1.0.0"
  release_date: "2024-01-01"
----
====

==== Versioned filenames

Formulas with import sources use differentiation keys for filename generation:

.macOS formulas (versioned)
[example]
====
[source]
----
macos/
├── font7/
│   ├── al_bayan_10m1360.yml
│   ├── arial_unicode_ms_10m1361.yml
│   └── ...
└── font8/
    ├── sf_pro_26m2001.yml
    └── ...
----
====

.Google Fonts formulas (simple, not versioned)
[example]
====
[source]
----
google/
├── roboto.yml
├── open_sans.yml
├── noto_sans.yml
└── ...
----

Google Fonts formulas use simple filenames because Google Fonts is a live service
that always points to the latest version. The `commit_id` in `import_source` is
tracked for metadata and update detection purposes only, not for filename
versioning.
====

.SIL formulas (versioned)
[example]
====
[source]
----
sil/
├── charis_sil_6.200.yml
├── andika_6.101.yml
└── ...
----
====

The filename format depends on the import source type:

* **macOS**: `{normalized_name}_{asset_id}.yml` (e.g., `al_bayan_10m1360.yml`)
* **Google Fonts**: `{normalized_name}.yml` (e.g., `roboto.yml`) - simple, no versioning
* **SIL**: `{normalized_name}_{version}.yml` (e.g., `charis_sil_6.200.yml`)

This approach enables:

* Multiple versions of the same font coexist (macOS, SIL)
* Clear tracking of font updates (all sources)
* Automatic update detection when catalogs refresh (all sources)
* Platform-specific version selection (macOS)
* Simple, consistent filenames for live services (Google Fonts)


=== Dynamically importing formulas from Google Fonts

==== General

https://fonts.google.com[Google Fonts] provides the largest collection of freely
and openly licensed fonts, including many that are widely used in web design and
digital publishing.

Fontist's https://github.com/fontist/formulas[formula library] includes support
for all fonts provided through Google Fonts, and maintains Fontist formulas for
all such fonts.

Fontist supports importing fonts from Google Fonts in multiple formats:

TTF:: (TrueType Font) Standard font files
VF:: (Variable Fonts) Fonts with adjustable design axes (weight, width, slant, etc.)
WOFF2:: (Web Open Font Format 2) Optimized web fonts

==== Data sources

Each Fontist Google Fonts formula is automatically generated and updated
using two data sources:

* The https://github.com/google/fonts[Google Fonts GitHub repository] provides
structured metadata and font file sources (OTF/TTF and Variable Fonts).

* The https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api[Google Fonts Developer API]
provides Google Fonts CDN URLs, static versions of Variable Fonts
and WOFF2 web font files.

==== Google Fonts API integration

Google Fonts API provides separate endpoints for TTF fonts, Variable Fonts, and
WOFF2 web fonts. Fontist integrates data from these endpoints and merges them
into a unified database.

The Google Fonts importer uses a layered, object-oriented architecture:

----
        ┌──────────────────────────┐
        │   FontDatabase           │
        │   (Single Entry Point)   │
        └───────────┬──────────────┘
                    │
      ┌─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┐
      ▼             ▼             ▼             ▼
┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
│   Ttf    │  │    Vf    │  │  Woff2   │  │  Github  │
│  (API)   │  │  (API)   │  │  (API)   │  │  (Repo)  │
└──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘

All 4 Data Sources Are Equal
----

==== Google Fonts importer architecture

The Google Fonts importer uses an ultra-simple architecture with FontDatabase as
the single entry point and four equal data sources:

Models (`lib/fontist/import/google/models/`)::
Data structures for font information
`FontFamily`::: Unified font data (API + Github metadata)
`Axis`::: Variable font axes information
`FontVariant`::: Individual font file data

Data Sources (`lib/fontist/import/google/data_sources/`)::
Four equal sources providing different information
`Ttf`::: Fetches TTF URLs from Google Fonts API
`Vf`::: Fetches variable font URLs + axes from Google Fonts API
`Woff2`::: Fetches WOFF2 URLs from Google Fonts API
`Github`::: Reads metadata from local google/fonts repository

Database (`lib/fontist/import/google/font_database.rb`)::
Single entry point for all operations
** Merges data from all 4 sources
** Query methods: `all_fonts`, `font_by_name`, `variable_fonts_only`
** Formula generation: `to_formula(name)`, `save_formulas(dir)`

API (`lib/fontist/import/google/api.rb`)::
Optional convenience facade for API-only operations

The Fontist Google Fonts can be used via Ruby library to query font data or
generate formulas:

[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
require 'fontist/import/google/font_database'

# Build database from all 4 sources (user must provide local path)
db = Fontist::Import::Google::FontDatabase.build(
  api_key: ENV['GOOGLE_FONTS_API_KEY'],
  source_path: '/path/to/google/fonts'  # Local checkout required
)

# Query merged data
roboto = db.font_by_name('Roboto')
puts roboto.designer      # From Github repository
puts roboto.axes.count    # From API (VF endpoint)

# Generate formulas
db.save_formulas('./formulas')  # All fonts
db.save_formulas('./formulas', family_name: 'Roboto')  # Single font

# API-only operations (no Github data)
families = Fontist::Import::Google::Api.items
variable_fonts = Fontist::Import::Google::Api.variable_fonts_only
----
====

For detailed usage examples, see
link:docs/google-fonts-multi-format-usage.md[Google Fonts Multi-Format Usage Guide].

==== Importing fonts from Google Fonts as Fontist Formulas

Prerequisites:

. Local git checkout of the https://github.com/google/fonts[google/fonts repository].
. Google Fonts Developer API key (set using `export GOOGLE_FONTS_API_KEY=your_api_key`).

To update Google Fonts formulas from a local checkout of the
https://github.com/google/fonts[google/fonts repository]:

[source,sh]
----
# GOOGLE_FONTS_API_KEY must be set in the environment
fontist import google \
  --source-path /path/to/google-fonts-github-repo \
  --output-path Formulas/google \
  --verbose \
  --import-cache /tmp/fontist-google-fonts-cache

git add Formulas/google
git commit -m "Google Fonts update"
git push
----

To import a single font for testing:

[source,sh]
----
fontist import google \
  --font-family "Roboto" \
  --source-path /path/to/google/fonts \
  --verbose
----


==== Automated updates

Fontist uses a
https://github.com/fontist/formulas/blob/v4/.github/workflows/google.yml[GHA workflow]
to check for updated fonts on Google Fonts daily.

New, updated, or removed fonts are automatically committed to the
https://github.com/fontist/formulas[Fontist formula repository].



=== Dynamically importing formulas from SIL

https://www.sil.org[SIL International] is an internationally recognized
faith-based nonprofit organization that serves language communities worldwide.

SIL provides a number of unique fonts that support smaller language communities
that with Unicode code often not (yet) supported by mainstream fonts.

Fontist aims to support all https://software.sil.org/fonts/[SIL fonts] and
provides their formulas in the default Fontist formula repository.

They can be updated with:

[source,sh]
----
cd Formulas
fontist import sil \
  --output-path Formulas/sil \
  --verbose \
  --import-cache /tmp/sil_import_cache

git add Formulas/sil
git commit -m "SIL fonts update"
git push
----

Importing a single SIL font for testing:

[source,sh]
----
fontist import sil \
  --font-name "Andika" \
  --output-path Formulas/sil \
  --verbose \
  --import-cache /tmp/sil_import_cache
----



=== Dynamically importing formulas from macOS

macOS provides https://support.apple.com/en-om/HT211240#download[fonts] which
can be manually downloaded with `Font Book.app`.

To update macOS formulas:

[source,sh]
----
# Font5 catalog (macOS 10.6)
curl -o com_apple_MobileAsset_Font5.xml \
  https://mesu.apple.com/assets/macos/com_apple_MobileAsset_Font5/com_apple_MobileAsset_Font5.xml

# Font6 catalog (macOS 10.7-10.10)
curl -o com_apple_MobileAsset_Font6.xml \
  https://mesu.apple.com/assets/macos/com_apple_MobileAsset_Font6/com_apple_MobileAsset_Font6.xml

# Font7 catalog (macOS 10.11-15.7)
curl -o com_apple_MobileAsset_Font7.xml \
  https://mesu.apple.com/assets/macos/com_apple_MobileAsset_Font7/com_apple_MobileAsset_Font7.xml

# Font8 catalog (macOS 26.0+)
curl -o com_apple_MobileAsset_Font8.xml \
  https://mesu.apple.com/assets/macos/com_apple_MobileAsset_Font8/com_apple_MobileAsset_Font8.xml
----

[source,sh]
----
cd Formulas
fontist import macos \
  --plist com_apple_MobileAsset_Font7.xml \
  --output-path Formulas/macos/font7 \
  --verbose \
  --import-cache /tmp/fontist-macos-cache \
  --force

git add Formulas/macos/font7
git commit -m "Update macOS formulas"
git push
----

Importing a single macOS font for testing:

[source,sh]
----
fontist import macos \
  --plist com_apple_MobileAsset_Font7.xml \
  --font-name "Hiragino" \
  --output-path Formulas/macos/font7 \
  --verbose \
  --import-cache /tmp/fontist-macos-cache
----


=== Import cache management

==== General

During formula imports, Fontist is required to download font archives from
various external sources for analysis to create accurate formulas.

To optimize performance and avoid redundant downloads, Fontist implements an
import cache for storing downloaded font files at:

* *Import cache* (`~/.fontist/import_cache`): Font archives downloaded during
formula building

Cache management is managed through the <<fontist-caches,`fontist cache`>>
command.


==== Configuring import cache

===== CLI option

[source,sh]
----
fontist import macos --import-cache /custom/path ...
fontist import google --import-cache /custom/path ...
fontist import sil --import-cache /custom/path ...
----

===== Ruby API

[source,ruby]
----
# Global setting
Fontist.import_cache_path = "/custom/import/cache"

# Per-import setting
Fontist::Import::Macos.new(
  plist_path,
  import_cache: "/custom/cache"
).call
----

===== Environment variable

[source,sh]
----
export FONTIST_IMPORT_CACHE=/custom/import/cache
fontist import macos ...
----


==== Verbose mode

Use `--verbose` to see detailed cache operations:

[source,sh]
----
$ fontist import macos --plist catalog.xml --verbose
----

OUTPUT includes:

* Import cache location
* Download URLs and cache status
* Extraction directory locations
* Cache cleanup notifications


=== Import command UI features
