agree that the terms of that license will govern your use of that product.
B. Apple, at its discretion, may make available future upgrades or updates to the Apple Software for your
Apple-branded computer. Upgrades and updates, if any, may not necessarily include all existing
software features or new features that Apple releases for newer or other models of Apple-branded
computers. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades or updates provided by Apple
that replace and/or supplement the original Apple Software product, unless such upgrade or update is
accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.
C. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by or accessed through the Apple
Software belongs to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by copyright or other
intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third party providing
such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any rights to use
such content nor does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.

need to separately authenticate with Apple prior to receiving the Apple Eligible Content and that the
expedited delivery of Apple Eligible Content through the use of your Caching Enabled Mac will not
modify the terms under which you or your end users receive such Apple Eligible Content.
3. You acknowledge and agree that all use of the Apple Eligible Content is subject to the applicable
license terms that govern the type of Apple Eligible Content being cached. These terms may include,
but are not limited to, the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions, the iCloud Terms and Conditions,
the iTunes U Instructor Agreement, the iTunes U Software License Agreement, and/or the applicable
licensing terms that accompanied the software being downloaded, unless the download was
accompanied by its own separate license agreement in which case the latter would apply.  A list of Apple
Software License Agreements (SLAs) may be found here: https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/. You
acknowledge and agree that the use of the Content Caching Features and storage of Apple Eligible
Content on your Caching Enabled Mac does not transfer to you any rights beyond those granted to you
in the applicable license terms for the Apple Eligible Content and shall not constitute a grant, waiver, or
other limitation of any rights of Apple or any other copyright owners in any Apple Eligible Content.
4. You are not authorized to deploy your Caching Enabled Mac with the Content Caching Features
enabled on a network you do not own or control (or which you are not legally authorized to use for such
purposes), or to permit access to such Apple Eligible Content from end users outside of your home,
company or organization. You agree to only use the Content Caching Features for your own personal,
non-commercial use or for internal use within your company or organization, and only as expressly
permitted herein. You may not provide a service to third parties that integrates with or leverages
services or information provided by the Content Caching Features or uses the Content Caching Features
in any way.

technical information about your Caching Enabled Mac and related networks, including but not limited
to, hardware identifiers and IP addresses, for such purposes. You agree not to disable, disrupt, hack,
circumvent, or otherwise interfere with Apple’s verification, storage or authentication mechanisms, digital
signing, digital rights management, or other security mechanisms implemented in or by the Apple
Software, services, the Apple Eligible Content, or other Apple software or technology, or to enable others
to do so.
6. Apple reserves the right to stop making Apple Eligible Content available for caching on your Caching
Enabled Mac (e.g., some content that you may have previously cached may not be available for
subsequent caching) and to remove any cached Apple Eligible Content from your Caching Enabled
Macs at any time in its sole discretion, and Apple shall have no liability to you in such event. You
understand that such caching of Apple Eligible Content may not be available in all countries or regions.
You may remove the cached Apple Eligible Content and disable the Content Caching Features at any
time.

planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you receive
from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can affect the
accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions, and
geopolitical events. For your safety, always pay attention to posted road signs and current road
conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and note that cycling and walking
directions may not include designated pathways.
H. To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Apple, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Apple. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Apple is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
I. In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Apple makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Apple and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable
access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Apple be liable for the removal of or
disabling of access to any such Services. Apple may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
