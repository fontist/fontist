    description: Ovo was inspired by a set of hand lettered caps seen in a 1930's
      lettering guide. The capitals suggested the time in which they were made because
      of the soft serif treatment used. This detail and a subtle casual feeling creeping
      into the otherwise classical forms led to the soft genial lowercase and the
      whimsical numbers now seen in Ovo. Ovo is a medium contrast serif font. Because
      of the old style variable letter widths and subtle detail it will work best
      at medium to large sizes.

  PREAMBLE
  The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

  names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
  however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
  requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
  to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
