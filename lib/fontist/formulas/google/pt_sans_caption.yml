    description: 'PT Sans is a type family of universal use. It consists of 8 styles:
      regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard computer
      font family; two narrow styles (regular and bold) are intended for documents
      that require tight set; two caption styles (regular and bold) are for texts
      of small point sizes. The design combines traditional conservative appearance
      with modern trends of humanistic sans serif and characterized by enhanced legibility.
      These features beside conventional use in business applications and printed
      stuff made the fonts quite useable for direction and guide signs, schemes, screens
      of information kiosks and other objects of urban visual communications.'
