    description: Modak is a Free and Open Source, Heavy-Chubby Devanagari-Latin display
      typeface. The design started off as one of our heavy hand sketched letterform
      explorations ...  The characters were cute/round and not bulky/rigid. The consonants
      and Matras were overlapping, instead of them being successive characters. Conjuncts
      were drawn as fused forms in which the two separate characters would merge into
      each other. The challenge was to maintain legibility and consistency in the
      thin white counter spaces across all characters irrespective of their structural
      complexity. In an attempt to translate this into a functional font, we designed
      additional Matras that would match exactly with every character, leaving a thin
      counter space in between. Custom Ukars were designed according to each character.
      The resulting typeface is one of its kind and probably the chubbiest Devanagari
      typeface to be designed so far. Modak Devanagari was designed by Sarang Kulkarni
      and Maithili Shingre and Modak Latin by Noopur Datye with support from Girish
      Dalvi and Pradnya Naik. We would like to thank Santosh Kshirsagar, Shubhanand
      Jog, Vinay Saynekar and Yashodeep Gholap for their suggestions and feedback
      during the font design process. We would also like to thank faculty and friends
      from the Industrial Design Centre, IIT Bombay and from Sir J J Institute of
      Applied Art for their support and encouragement. This project is led by [Ek
      Type]( http://ektype.in/), a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused
      on designing contemporary Indian typefaces.
