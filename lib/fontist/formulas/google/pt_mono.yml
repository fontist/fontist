    description: PT Mono -- is a monospaced font of the PT Project series. First families
      PT Sans and PT Serif were released in 2009 and 2010. PT Mono was developed  for
      the special needs -- for use in forms, tables, work sheets etc. Equal widths
      of characters are very helpful in setting complex documents, with such font
      you may easily calculate size of entry fields, column widths in tables and so
      on. One of the most important area of use is Web sites of "electronic governments"
      where visitors have to fill different request forms. Designer Alexandra Korolkova
      with a participation of Bella Chaeva. Released by ParaType in 2011.
