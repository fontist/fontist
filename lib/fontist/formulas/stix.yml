    description: Arie de Ruiter, who in 1995 was Head of Information Technology Development
      at Elsevier Science, made a proposal to the STI Pub group, an informal group
      of publishers consisting of representatives from the American Chemical Society
      (ACS), American Institute of Physics (AIP), American Mathematical Society (AMS),
      American Physical Society (APS), Elsevier, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics
      Engineers (IEEE). De Ruiter encouraged the members to consider development of
      a series of Web fonts, which he proposed should be called the Scientific and
      Technical Information eXchange, or STIX, Fonts. All STI Pub member organizations
      enthusiastically endorsed this proposal, and the STI Pub group agreed to embark
      on what has become a twelve-year project. The goal of the project was to identify
      all alphabetic, symbolic, and other special characters used in any facet of
      scientific publishing and to create a set of Unicode-based fonts that would
      be distributed free to every scientist, student, and other interested party
      worldwide. The fonts would be consistent with the emerging Unicode standard,
      and would permit universal representation of every character. With the release
      of the STIX fonts, de Ruiter's vision has been realized.
