    description: Trebuchet, designed by Vincent Connare in 1996, is a humanist sans
      serif designed for easy screen readability. Trebuchet takes its inspiration
      from the sans serifs of the 1930s which had large x heights and round features
      intended to promote readability on signs. The typeface name is credited to a
      puzzle heard at Microsoft, where the question was asked, "could you build a
      Trebuchet (a form of medieval catapult) to launch a person from the main campus
      to the consumer campus, and how?" The Trebuchet fonts are intended to be the
      vehicle that fires your messages across the Internet. "Launch your message with
