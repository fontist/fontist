    description: 'Cambria has been designed for on-screen reading and to look good
      when printed at small sizes. It has very even spacing and proportions. Diagonal
      and vertical hairlines and serifs are relatively strong, while horizontal serifs
      are small and intend to emphasize stroke endings rather than stand out themselves.
      This principle is most noticeable in the italics where the lowercase characters
      are subdued in style to be at their best as elements of word-images. When Cambria
      is used for captions at sizes over 20 point, the  inter-character spacing should
      be slightly reduced for best results. The design isn''t just intended for business
      documents: The regular weight has been extended with a large set of math and
      science symbols. The Greek and Cyrillic has been designed under close supervision
      of an international team of experts, who aimed to set a historical new standard
      in multi-script type design.'

      shapes for a number of lowercase letters. The look of text can be tuned to personal
      taste by varying the number of bars and waves.
